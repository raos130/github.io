  When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, <span class="quick"> I lived alone,
  in the woods,</span> a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself,
   on the shore of<a class="walden" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_Pond"> Walden Pond</a>, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living
   by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At
   present I am a <a class="word" href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sojourner">sojourner</a> in civilized life again.

I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very
particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen <span class="yellow">concerning my mode of life,</span>
 which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent,
 but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what
 I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like.
