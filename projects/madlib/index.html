    <p> Last night while I was scrolling through <span class="word-websiteName"></span>, I noticed a <span class="word-adjective2">
    </span> advertisement for <span class="word-pluralNoun1"></span>. I immediately began <span class="word-verbEndingInIng"></span>
    and called my <span class="word-noun1"></span>. She advised me to use my <span class="word-artSupply"></span> and eat
    <span class="word-foods"></span>. None of that helped so I went to my best friend
     <span class="word-celebrityName"></span> who moonlights as a <span class="word-noun2"></span>. He only charges
      $<span class="word-numbers"></span> an hour, which I think is quite reasonable. He began telling me about his new lover
      <span class="word-artistName"></span> and her <span class="word-adjective1"></span> <span class="word-bodyPart"></span>.
      I got bored, so I began looking up <span class="word-pluralNoun2"></span> on <span class="word-computerSoftware"></span>.
      Unfortunately, he kept talking so I left his place and headed towards <span class="word-placeInNewYork"></span> where I passed out
      near some <span class="word-pluralNoun3"></span>.

<!--

      and <span class="word-adjective1"></span> <span class="word-pluralNoun3"></span>. -->
