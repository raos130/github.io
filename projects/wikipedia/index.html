<h3>Plot summary</h3>
<p>
The book begins with city council workmen arriving at Arthur Dent's house. They wish to demolish his house
in order to build a bypass.
Arthur's best friend, Ford Prefect, arrives, warning him of the end of the world. Ford is revealed to be an
alien who had come to Earth to research it for the titular Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an enormous
work providing information about every planet and place in the universe. The two head to a pub, where the
locals question Ford's knowledge of the Apocalypse. An alien race, known as Vogons, show up to demolish Earth
in order to build a bypass for an intergalactic highway. Arthur and Ford manage to get onto the Vogon ship
just before Earth is demolished, where they are forced to listen to horrible Vogon poetry as a form of torture.
Arthur and Ford are ordered to say how much they like the poetry in order to avoid being thrown out of the airlock,
and while Ford finds listening to be painful, Arthur believes it to be genuinely good, since human poetry is
apparently even worse.
<br>
<br>
Arthur and Ford are then placed into the airlock and jettisoned into space, only to be rescued by Zaphod Beeblebrox's ship,
the Heart of Gold. Zaphod, a semi-cousin of Ford, is the President of the Galaxy, and is accompanied by a depressed robot named
Marvin and a human woman by the name of Trillian. The five embark on a journey to find the legendary planet known as Magrathea,
known for selling luxury planets. Once there, they are taken into the planet's centre by a man named Slartibartfast. There, they
learn that a supercomputer named Deep Thought, who determined the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything to be the
number 42, created Earth as an even greater computer to calculate the question to which 42 is the answer.
<br>
<br>
Trillian's mice, actually part of the group of sentient and hyper-intelligent superbeings that had Earth created in the first place,
reject the idea of building a second Earth to redo the process, and offer to buy Arthur's brain in the hope that it contains the question,
leading to a fight when he declines. Zaphod saves Arthur when the brain is about to be removed, and the group decides to go to
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

Ed Victor as the two space cops, and many other designs by Kevin Davies, who has participated in many Hitchhiker's
related projects since the stage productions in the late 1970s. Davies himself appears as Prosser. This edition

<h3> In other media </h3>

<h4>Audiobook adaptations</h4>
<p>
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition (ISBN 0-671-62964-6),
recorded in the mid-1980s by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in
the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition
for Dove Audiobooks (ISBN 1-55800-273-1), later re-released by New Millennium Audio (ISBN 1-59007-257-X) in
the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by arrangement with Dove,
ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams (ISBN 1-85695-028-X) in 1994.
To tie-in with the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film's voice of the Guide, recorded a second unabridged
edition (ISBN 0-7393-2220-6).

<h4>Television series</h4>
<p>
Main article: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)
The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by
Alan J. W. Bell, which first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors
from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First through Sixth. A second
series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey that would
have come from Adams's abandoned Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen project (instead of simply making a TV
version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ:
problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell involved are all offered as causes), and the second series
was never made. Elements of Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen were instead used in the third novel, Life,
the Universe and Everything. The main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David
Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern, and Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.

<h4>Film adaptation</h4>
<p>
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was adapted into a science fiction comedy film directed by
Garth Jennings and released on 28 April 2005 in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and on the
following day in the United States and Canada. It was rolled out to cinemas worldwide during
May, June, July, August and September.
